            <dd class="mb-4">phones, cars, and other digital devices optimized for 5G networks speed. 5G devices are limited by the speed of the network they are on.</dd>
          
            <dt>5G (network)</dt>
            <dd class="mb-4">the fifth generation, small-cell, cellular network technology that provides broadband access. High-speed cellular networks require a fiber network. 5G requires deep fiber.</dd>
          
            <dt>Broadband</dt>
            <dd class="mb-4">A federally defined minimum speed of 25/3 Mbps that is based on the national average. high-speed internet.</dd>
          
            <dt>Deep fiber</dt>
            <dd class="mb-4">fiber cables that serve customers directly, often referred to as fiber to the premise or fiber to the home (FTTH). This is the fastest and most reliable internet.</dd>
          
            <dt>Digital Divide</dt>
            <dd class="mb-4">the opportunity gap between people or communities who have access to computers and high-speed internet and those who don’t.</dd>

            <dd class="mb-4">receive and consume data. Examples: email, video, and audio in video chat, text messages, pictures, documents, watch video on a smart TV or another device, streaming</dd>
          
            <dt>Download speed vs upload speed</dt>
            <dd class="mb-4">Internet speeds are given as two numbers, first the download speed and then the upload speed. There can be a large difference between these two numbers. Most commonly measured in Megabytes per second (Mb/s). Examples: 10/1 (slow), 25/3 (minimum broadband), 100/15 (high).</dd>
