            <div class="text-lg">
              <p>The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) defines broadband as having minimum data transfer speeds of 25/3 (25 megabytes per second download / 3 mb/s upload).</p>
<p>Our group takes this definition a bit further. While there are Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in our community who can achieve those data speeds at peak times, they cannot reliably guarantee those speeds. We also look at their ability to provide increased speeds in the future. If their networks are at their current limit now, they will not be sufficient in the future.</p>

            <div class="text-lg">
              <p>There are many reasons why high speed internet (hsri) is important.</p>
<p>Our community currently uses the internet for school, continuing education, work, telehealth and business. For each of these needs, high speed internet is important.</p>
<p>TODO this is a stub - needs to be compelling and address 5G, beyond 5G, etc. </p>

              <p>Spectrum / Charter is the only Internet Service Provider (ISP) in our community capable of meeting our group’s minimum threshold for "high speed internet". They offer several internet packages that exceed this minimum definition.</p>

Take this question:<br>
"I need high speed internet service in St George that will grow with my needs for the foreseeable future."
</p>
<p>You need internet transmitted through fiber optic cables.</p>
<p>Spectrum has their own private service lines all over the peninsula with fiber optic trunk lines on Rt 131 (at least). In order to serve a neighborhood within the community with fiber, they would need to tap into the nearest fiber line.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Costs less</li>
<li>Takes less time (maybe)</li>
<li>Spectrum could subsidize the build out (of their own network)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Spectrum owns the network and the equipment.</li>
<li>If we help them pay for it, our Town has subsidized building their network.</li>

            <div class="text-lg">
              <p>
Take the same question:<br>
"I need high speed internet service in St George that will grow with my needs for the foreseeable future."
</p>
<p>You need internet transmitted through fiber optic cables.</p>
<p>A non-incumbent provider has no fiber optic cable in St George. However, the nearest public fiber is on Rt 1. That’s relatively close (compared to many other communities with the same issue).</p>

<p>In order to serve fiber to St George, a non-incumbent would need to run fiber down Rt 131 to St George. This main cable is referred to as a trunk line. Smaller cables that run from the trunkline are branchlines.  </p>

<p>Incumbents (Spectrum) typically do not share access to any of their lines.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After a trunk line is run, other costs would likely be similar to Spectrum’s costs</li>
<li>Smaller, non-incumbents can offer municipalities ways in which to pay for the build out (see Ownership Models)</li>
<li>If the Town of St George owns the fiber network, they can lease it to any service provider now or into the future.</li>
<li>It’s typical that there’s an upfront contract that determines which ISP(s) will operate on the network (at least to start). </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The initial expense of running fiber from Rt 1 down Rt 131 is high.</li>
</ul>
